### Business Case: "Employee Training Tracker"

#### Business Need:

A growing mid-sized company, "TechSolutions Inc.", is facing challenges in managing employee training. They currently rely on spreadsheets and scattered emails, leading to:

* Lack of Centralization: Difficulty tracking which employees have completed which training.
* Inefficient Scheduling: Manual scheduling of training sessions leads to conflicts and delays.
* Poor Reporting: Inability to generate reports on employee training progress and compliance.
*  Missed Deadlines: Difficulty tracking certification renewals and training deadlines.

#### Solution:

Develop an Odoo 16 module, "Employee Training Tracker," to streamline and automate the company's training management process.

#### Technical Requirements (Focus Areas for Developer Revision):

1. Models:
    * training.course:
        * Fields: name (Char), description (Text), duration (Integer), category (Selection), certification_required (Boolean), renewal_period (Integer, if certification_required).
        * Methods: calculate_expiry_date() (calculates certification expiry based on renewal period).
    * training.session:
        * Fields: course_id (Many2one), start_date (Date), end_date (Date), instructor (Char), attendees (Many2many to res.users).
        * Methods: check_session_overlap() (validates no overlapping sessions for an instructor).
    * training.completion:
        * Fields: employee_id (Many2one to res.users), course_id (Many2one), completion_date (Date), expiry_date (Date, computed based on course and renewal period).
        * Methods: create_completion_record() (automatically creates completion record when a user is added to a training session).
    * training.wizard.add_attendees:
        * Fields: session_id (Many2one), attendees (Many2many to res.users).
        * Methods: add_attendees_and_create_completion() (adds attendees to session and creates training completion records).
2. Views:

    * Course Views:
        * Tree view: Display course name, category, and duration.
        * Form view: Detailed course information with category selection and certification renewal options.
    * Session Views:
        * Calendar view: Display scheduled training sessions.
        * Form view: Display session details, attendees, and instructor.
    * Completion Views:
        * Tree view: Display employee, course, completion date, and expiry date.
        * Form view: Display all completion details.
        * Search views: Search completion records by employee, course, or date.
    * Wizard Views:
        * Form view: for the add attendees wizard.
3. Wizards:

    * "Add Attendees" wizard: Allows adding multiple employees to a training session and automatically creates completion records.
4. Actions and Menus:

    * Create menu items for "Courses," "Sessions," and "Completions."
    * Create actions to open the respective views.
    * Add a button to the training session form to open the add attendees wizard.

    * Create a security group for training managers.
6. Reporting:

    * Create a basic report to list employees with expired certifications.
    * Create a basic report to list all employees and the training courses that they have completed.
#### Developer Tasks (Revision Focus):

* Design and implement the required models, views, and wizards.
* Implement business logic within model methods (e.g., expiry date calculation, session overlap validation).
* Create user-friendly views and menus.
* Implement security measures to control access.
* Create basic reports.

#### Learning Objectives:

* Reinforce understanding of Odoo 16 model, view, wizard, and security concepts.
